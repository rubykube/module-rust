##  Objectives
* Using crates

## TO DO
You should implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game. Hereâ€™s how it works: the program will generate a random integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After entering a guess, it will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high. If the guess is correct, the game will print congratulations and exit.
